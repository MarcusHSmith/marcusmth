If I need to look up multiple times, I should just record it in my own cheatsheet.

`CMD + SHIFT + O` Open new file

`CTR + CMD + ARROW` Go back or forward to another file

`OPTION + CMD + O` Open git window

`CMD + SHIFT + J` Reveal file in Project Navigator

If I found a read useful, I should maintain a link to it.
