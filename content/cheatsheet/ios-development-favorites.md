If I need to look up multiple times, I should just record it in my own cheatsheet.

`⌘ + ⇧ + O` Open new file

`CTR + ⌘ + ARROW` Go back or forward to another file

`⌥ + ⌘ + O` Open git window

`⌘ + ⇧ + J` Reveal file in Project Navigator

`⌘ + L` Goto line number

`Editor > Authors` Git blame within XCode

`⌥ + ⌘ + ⇧ + F` Find and Replace entire workspace

To iterate over an enum type ensure it is `CaseIterable`

`⌘ + ⇧ + {` OR `⌘ + ⇧ + }` Switch tabs

If I found a read useful, I should maintain a link to it.
